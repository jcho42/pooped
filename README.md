# Pooped app

A simple mobile app that keeps track of your bowel movements (poop).
Inspired by my friend who has problems with IBS.

## Brief Description

The Pooped app allows a user to record and visualize their bowel movements to keep track of their gut health. A user is able to record the particular day with one of the stool types based on the [Bristol Stool chart](https://www.webmd.com/digestive-disorders/poop-chart-bristol-stool-scale). The user can also choose one of the following tabs to view their data in a graphical form (bar and pie chart): Today, Week, Month, Year.
